  ## How can I get involved?
  First things first, educate yourself on the [scope](https://github.com/lfe-cds/Steering_Committee/blob/main/Scope.md) of the project and the processes for how the working groups operates. Depending on your desired level of engagement, your involvement could look like the following:
  1. **I'd like visibility on the progress.** Great, register for the [CDS monthly community meetings](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meeting/99111842486) and join the [cds-general](https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/cds-general) email list. Monthly updates and presentations will be saved [here](https://drive.google.com/corp/drive/folders/1P0eM0h7kvTBNcjYWpe7H0aVQPPgJ3TTY). 
  2. **I'd like to provide light feedback on the specifications.** For this, you should review the respective working groups GitHub repos and follow the contribution guidelines defined for each working group ( CONTRIBUTING.md ).
  3. **I'd like to actively participate and contribute.** This requires more commitment, but also helps you drive more value. The steps here would be to join the respective working group's communication channels and meetings listed in each working group's GitHub repository, participating in the discussions and providing your feedback and insight.

To help resource this project to enable adoption and implementation of what we produce, consider becoming an [LF Energy Foundation member](https://www.lfenergy.org/join/), which provides financial and infrastructural support for the CDS.
